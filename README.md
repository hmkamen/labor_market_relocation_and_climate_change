# Labor Market, Relocation, and Climate Change

This repository contains code and analysis for my research on how climate change affects labor markets and household relocation decisions.

The project combines climate data with labor market and migration outcomes to study how workers and firms adapt to both acute climate shocks and long-run warming.
